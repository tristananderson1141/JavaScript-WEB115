	<blockquote>My name is Tristan Anderson. I am a Information Techonology: Computer Programming and Development
		major at Wake Tech Community College. I am about halfway through this major and have enjoyed making progress
		learning in this field. I plan to become a software developer after spending time in an entry level
		position in the same field. In my freetime I enjoy gardening vegetables, playing video games, exploring
		the world of computers and technology, and biking/running to stay in good health.
